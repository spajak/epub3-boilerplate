    <p>Originally the knight characters were going to ride <em>real</em> horses, but after it became clear that the film's small budget precluded real horses (except for a lone horse appearing in a couple of scenes), the Pythons decided that their characters would <em>mime</em> horse-riding while their porters trotted behind them banging <strong>coconut</strong> shells together. The joke was derived from the old-fashioned sound effect used by radio shows to convey the sound of hooves clattering.</p>
    <h5>Some useless numbers:</h5>
    <p>This movie <b>budget</b>: $4 × 10<sup>5</sup>; <strong>words</strong> in this e-book: 2123; speed of a <strong>swallow</strong>: 50 – 65 km/h; <strong>alcohol</strong> chemical formula: C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH, kinetic energy of a flying <strong>mosquito</strong>: 1.602 × 10<sup>−7</sup> J, <strong>Avogadro</strong> number: 6.02214076 × 10<sup>23</sup>; <strong>neurons</strong> in a human brain: 10<sup>9</sup> (at least on average).</p>
