<h2 class="mt-0">Swamps Suck Castles</h2>

<p>Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the <strong>Grail</strong>. Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedemir, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something. Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously. I mean, they were more than two laden swallow's flights away, four, really, if they hadn't a cord of line between them. I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging.</p>

<p class="asterism-3"></p>

<p>I've built this kingdom up from <em>nothing</em>. When I started here, all there was was swamp. All the kings said I was daft to build a castle in a <em>swamp</em>, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So, I built a second one. That sank into the swamp. So I built a third one. That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp. But the fourth one stayed up. An' that's what your gonna get, lad, the strongest castle in these islands.</p>

<p>To the north there lies a <em>cave</em>, the cave of Kyre Banorg, wherein, carved in <em>mystic</em> runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Ulfin Bedweer of Regett... [boom] ...proclaim the last resting place of the most <strong>Holy Grail</strong>. Where could we find this cave, O Tim? Follow! But! follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived! Bones of four fifty men lie strewn about its lair. So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty big pointy teeth. What an eccentric performance.</p>

<p>And we'd better not risk another frontal assault. That rabbit's dynamite. We have the <strong>Holy Hand Grenade</strong>. Yes, of course! <a id="grenade">The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch</a>! 'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him! Brother Maynard! Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade! How does it <em>work</em>? Consult the Book of Armaments! Armaments, chapter two, verses nine to twenty-one.</p>

<blockquote class="small"><p>Arthur and his knights regroup and are joined by three new knights as well as Brother Maynard and his monk followers. They meet Tim the Enchanter, who directs them to a cave where the location of the Grail is said to be written, but it is guarded by the deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog. After the Rabbit <strong>kills</strong> Sirs Gawain, Ector, and Bors, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, provided by Maynard, to destroy the <em>creature</em>.</p>
<p>Inside, they find the inscription from Joseph of Arimathea, directing them to the Castle of Aarrgh. After evading a giant monster, they arrive at the Bridge of Death and must answer three questions from the bridge-keeper to pass. Lancelot answers first and correctly, and passes on. Robin and Galahad fail to answer correctly and are thrown over the bridge. Then Arthur asks for clarification of one of the bridge-keeper's questions - which throws the bridge-keeper over the bridge, allowing Arthur and Bedevere to pass.</p></blockquote>
