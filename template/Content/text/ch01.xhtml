<h2 class="chapter">Bring Out Your Dead</h2>

<p>Halt! Who goes there? It is I, Arthur, <em>son</em> of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, <em>defeater</em> of the Saxons, Sovereign of all England! I am, and this is my trusty servant Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of <strong>knights</strong> who will join me in my court at Camelot. I must speak with your lord and master.</p>

<p>
– Who's that then?<br/>
– I don't know. Must be a king.<br/>
– Why?<br/>
– He hasn't got shit all over him
</p>

<h3>King of the Britons</h3>

<p>How do you do, good lady. I am Arthur, King of the Britons. Who's castle is that? King of the who? The Britons. Who are the <em>Britons</em>? Well, we all are. we're all Britons and I am your king. I didn't know we had a king. I thought we were an <strong>autonomous collective</strong>. You're fooling yourself. We're living in a <em>dictatorship</em>. A <i>self-perpetuating autocracy</i> in which the working classes... Oh there you go, bringing class into it again. That's what it's all about if only people would... Please, please good people. I am in haste. Who lives in that castle? No one live there. Then who is your lord? We don't have a lord. What? I told you. We're an <i>anarcho-syndicalist commune</i>. We take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week. Yes. But all the decision of that officer have to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting. I am your king! Well, I didn't vote for you. You don't vote for kings.</p>

<p class="box w-70 s-1">Oh, King, eh, very nice. And how d'you get that, eh? By exploiting the workers! By 'anging on to <em>outdated</em> imperialist dogma which <b>perpetuates</b> the economic and social differences in our society.</p>

    <dt>Dictatorship</dt>
    <dd>An authoritarian form of government, characterized by a single leader or group of leaders with either no party or a weak party, little mass mobilization, and limited political pluralism.</dd>

<p>The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft <i id="excalibur">Excalibur</i> from the bosom of the water signifying by Divine Providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king! Listen, strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.</p>

<h3>Black Knight</h3>

<p>You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight. I am Arthur, King of the Britons. I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me in my <strong>Court of Camelot</strong>. You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me? You make me sad. So be it. Come, Patsy.</p>

<p>
– None shall pass.<br/>
– What?<br/>
– None shall pass.<br/>
– I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must cross this bridge.<br/>
– Then you shall die.<br/>
– I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!<br/>
– I move for no man.<br/>
– So be it! Now stand aside, worthy adversary
</p>

<p class="i b">After a while..</p>

<p>'Tis but a scratch. A scratch? Your arm's off! No, it isn't. Well, what's that then? I've had worse. You liar! Come on you pansy! Victory is mine! We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc- [hah] Come on then. What? Have at you! You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine. Oh, had enough, eh? Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left. Yes I have. Look! Just a flesh wound. Look, stop that. Chicken! Chicken! Look, I'll have your leg. Right! Right, I'll do you for that! You'll what? Come 'ere! What are you going to do, bleed on me? I'm invincible! You're a loony. Oh, oh, I see! Running away, eh? You yellow bastards! Come back here and take what's coming to you! I'll bite your legs off!</p>
